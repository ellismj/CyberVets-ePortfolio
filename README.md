Welcome to my ePortfolio!

I am an aspiring cybersecuirty analyst, and in this space you will find projects that I have worked on as well as a journal that documents my experience learning various tools and skills utilized within cybersecurity.

This begins with my impending transition out of the military and my current internship with the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) CyberVets program. This internship is a DoD-approved SkillBridge program and is a six-month rotation at CMS where service members engage in problem-based, “on the job” cybersecurity training. The program begins with a solid foundation in networking fundamentals and network security essentials; and then progresses into more advanced areas such as reverse engineering, threat management, policy, and compliance management.

I intend to keep growing this ePortfolio, even after my internship, as I continue my journey through this field; eventually showing my compentencies, achievements, certifications, and the people and resources that have helped me along the way.
